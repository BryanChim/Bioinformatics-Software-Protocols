1) Convert the .rpkm_# output files using the edgeToDeseq.perl script (in the additionalScripts directory of the EDGE-pro installation folder)

perl edgeToDeseq.perl xxx.rpkm_0 yyy.rpkm_0

* where xxx and yyy are the prefixes of the groups you want to compare

2) Transfer the output (called deseqFile, by default - but you should probably rename it) -- to your working directory on your computer that has R installed.

3) Assuming you have Bioconductor installed, proceed to install DESeq by entering the following:

source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
bioclite()
biocLite("DESeq")

And then you can load the DESeq module with:

library("DESeq") 

whenever you restart R.

4) With DESeq installed and loaded, set your working directory in R:

> setwd( '\working directory\' )

*when entering working directory path, must escape backslashes ('\\') 

5) Read in your counts table:

> data = read.table( "deseqFile", header=TRUE, row.names=1 )

6) Set the names of your conditions, and then generate a CountDataSet object (the basic data structure for DESeq)

> condition = factor( c( "C1", "C2" ) )

> cds = newCountDataSet( data, condition )

7) estimate Size Factors and Dispersions -- DESeq's form of normalization:

> cds = estimateSizeFactors ( cds )

> cds = estimateDispersions ( cds, method='blind', sharingMode='fit-only' )

8) Perform the negative Binomial Distribution tests:

> res = nbinomTest ( cds, "C1", "C2" )

* note, the condition names C1 and C2 must match the names you chose when you declared the "condition" above

9) Output to a table:

> write.table ( res, "C1--C2_sig_genes.txt", sep='\t', row.names=F )
